20.9 Enumerations
=================
Scala does not require specific language support for 
enumerations like java and C#. You need simply extend
class Enumeration 

object Color extends Enumeration{
  val Red, Green, Blue = Value
}

The primary thing to note is the "Value". It is a path 
dependent type. With Color being the path and Value being
the type.

You can associate names by using various overloaded variants
of the Value method.

object Direction extends Enumeration {
  val North = Value("North")
  val South= Value("South")
  val East = Value("East")
  val West = Value("West")
}

you can iterate over values by using the values method.

for (d <- Direction.values) print(d + " ") 

or find the ordinal with its id method

Direction.East.id
Int = 1
