21.2 Implicits
Scala compiler first attempts to compile as is
then it looks to see if there are any implicits that
it could use to resolve the type error.

The implicit keyword marks which declarations the compiler 
will consider for implicit conversions.

There are three places implicits are used:
1. Converting to an expected type

2. Conversions of the reciever of a selection
   if you call a method that does not exist on an
   object, but an implicit conversion exists that could 
   decorate that object with that method.

3. implicit parameters
