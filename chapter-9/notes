Reducing Duplications:
  Functions are seperated into common parts
    - common parts are the body
    - non common parts are supplied by parameter
    - we can supply function values as parameters where the parameter is itself another algorithm
    - we can use higher order functions to condense and simplify code

  Place Holders in FileMatcher.scala example:
    - beecause the params are each only used once, and they are used in a specific order we can use
      place holder syntax
